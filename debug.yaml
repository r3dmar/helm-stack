                                          as the following: \n * Gateway: Listener
                                          Name. When both Port (experimental) and
                                          SectionName are specified, the name and
                                          port of the selected listener must match
                                          both specified values. \n Implementations
                                          MAY choose to support attaching Routes to
                                          other resources. If that is the case, they
                                          MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                          interpreted. \n When unspecified (empty

                                          resource. For the purpose of status, an
                                          attachment is considered successful if at
                                          least one section in the parent resource
                                          accepts it. For example, Gateway listeners
                                          can restrict which Routes can attach to
                                          them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname.
                                          If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST
                                          be considered successfully attached. If
                                          no Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                                          this Route, the Route MUST be considered
                                          detached from the Gateway. \n Support: Core"
